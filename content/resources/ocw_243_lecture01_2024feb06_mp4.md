    \nThis lecture covers: Definitions of system, property, state, dynamical law,\
    \ process, weight process. Statement of the First Law. Definition of energy. Energy\
    \ balance. Definitions of steady, unsteady, nonequilibrium, and stable, unstable\
    \ and metastable equilibrium states.\n\nInstructor suggests to set viewing speed\
